# unique-word-frequency
This C program tracks the number of unique words in a file. The program accepts two parameters - an input text file and an output file - and counts the number of unique words in the input file. It outputs to the screen the total number of unique words, and prints each word once to the given output file. The output file contains each word and the number of times it appears in the file, in descending order of frequency.
